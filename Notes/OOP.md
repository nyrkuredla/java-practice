# Object-Oriented Programming (Java style)

## What is an object?
(from: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html)
* State vs. behavior
* I've seen this before in JavaScript, except that variables are now "fields" and functions are now "methods" :)
* Interestingly put: methods as "mechanism for object-to-object communication".
* Data encapsulation: when all internal state is hidden and all interaction with an object is through methods.
  * "By attributing state and providing methods for changing that state, the object remains in control of how the outside world is allowed to use it."

### Benefits of using objects
* Modularity;
* Information-hiding (part of the same thing, really, as modularity);
* Code re-use (ditto);
* Pluggability and code re-use (di..tritto?). Replace the cog, not the entire machine.  

## What is a class?
